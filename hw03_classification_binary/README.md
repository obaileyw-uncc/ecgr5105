# ECGR 5105 Homework 3: Binary Classification
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 3 including the PDF and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw03_classification_binary.ipynb](hw03_classification_binary.ipynb). The main file [hw03_classification_binary.pdf](hw03_classification_binary.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.
