# ECGR 5105 Homework 1: Gradient descent algorithm
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 1 including both PDFs and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw01_gradientdescent.ipynb](hw01_gradientdescent.ipynb). The file [hw01_gradientdescent_notebook.pdf](hw01_gradientdescent_notebook.pdf) contains a PDF printout of the Jupyter notebook, while the main file [hw01_gradientdescent.pdf](hw01_gradientdescent.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.
