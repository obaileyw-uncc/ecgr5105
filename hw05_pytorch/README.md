# ECGR 5105 Homework 5: PyTorch and Neural Networks on the CPU
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 5 including the PDF and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw05_pytorch.ipynb](hw05_pytorch.ipynb). The main file [hw05_pytorch.pdf](hw05_pytorch.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter file will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.
