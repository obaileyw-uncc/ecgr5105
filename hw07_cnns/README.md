# ECGR 5105 Homework 7: Convolutional Neural Networks
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 7 including the PDF and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw07_cnns.ipynb](hw07_cnns.ipynb). The main file [hw07_cnns.pdf](hw07_cnns.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. This program used the CIFAR-10 image dataset, which is automatically downloaded by the code in the notebook.
