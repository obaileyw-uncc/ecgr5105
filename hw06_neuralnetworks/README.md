# ECGR 5105 Homework 6: Neural Network Applications
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 6 including the PDF and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw06_neuralnetworks.ipynb](hw06_neuralnetworks.ipynb). The main file [hw06_neuralnetworks.pdf](hw06_neuralnetworks.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.
