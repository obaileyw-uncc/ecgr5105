# ECGR 5105 Homework 4: Support Vector Machines
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 4 including the PDF and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw04_supportvectormachines.ipynb](hw04_supportvectormachines.ipynb). The main file [hw04_supportvectormachines.pdf](hw04_supportvectormachines.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.
