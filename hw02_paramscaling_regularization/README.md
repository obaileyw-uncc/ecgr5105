# ECGR 5105 Homework 1: Gradient descent algorithm
This folder contains all the pertinent files from Homework 1 including both PDFs and the homework's Python programs.

The programs and their documentation are located in the Jupyter notebook [hw02_paramscaling_regularization.ipynb](hw02_paramscaling_regularization.ipynb). The main file [hw02_paramscaling_regularization.pdf](hw02_paramscaling_regularization.pdf) is the answers to the homework's questions. The latter files will be included in the homework submission on Canvas. A copy of the dataset is also included in this folder purely for reference purposes.

I have also written a handful of APIs that perform gradient descent with and without regularization as well as feature scaling. These functions are implemented in the Jupyter notebook and have also been copied to the Python file [mlorb.py](mlorb.py) for potential future use.
